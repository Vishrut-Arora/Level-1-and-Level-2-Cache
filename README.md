# Level-1-and-Level-2-Cache
## A program that allows loading into cache and searching cache using:
- Direct mapping 
- Associative memory
- n-way set associative memory where n is a power of 2.

### For the 2 level cache:
- The size of the level 1 cache is S/2 and the size of level 2 cache is S. All the other parameters are to be decided accordingly. This will also be a standalone cache without the intervention of the main memory.
